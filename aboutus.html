							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/lastfm_logo.png" alt="" /></span>LastQuiz is a website that integrates the use of Last.fm to generate unique and interesting quizzes for its users.</p>
							
							
							<hr />
							
							
							
							
							<p>To clear up any confusion here is a quick description of what Last.fm is and how it works for those who have never heard of it before. Last.fm is a website where users can create an account and track their recently listened to music. Last.fm connects straight to your local player such as Spotify or iTunes and records every song, album and artists you listen to in real time.</p>
							
							<p>This information is then displayed on your profile. Your profile also displays your top (most listened to) artists, albums and songs. This can be filtered by time such as top artists for the week or month. What last quiz aims to deliver is a site that intergrates the use of last.fm and its data to create quizzes that are interesting for its users.</p>
							
							
							<hr />
							
							
							<p>The way LastQuiz utilizes data from Last.fm is via your last.fm profile. Inout your unique last.fm username into LastQuiz and it will generate a quiz based off the varibles you selected (what type of quiz) and the data on your Last.fm profile.</p>
							
							<p>You may be asking why or how I came up with this idea for a website? I have used Last.fm for a few years now with about 20,000 recorded plays so I am quite familiar with the site and the appeal to tracking your music, sharing it with friends etc. The concept of a quiz website is simple but the real complexity comes with how the data is pulled and how quizzes are generated.</p>
